# MediGuard AI

MediGuard AI is a Flutter mobile application for remote patient monitoring and device management. The app ingests real-time physiological data (ECG, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc.), displays live charts and historical trends, surfaces critical cases, and provides an AI-assisted assistant for summaries and guidance.

## Features

- Firebase authentication and user accounts

- Real-time device data ingestion and display (Firebase Realtime Database)

- Device management UI for adding and linking devices to patients

- Patient dashboard and per-patient detail pages with charts (`fl_chart`)

- Critical-case detection and UI alerts

- AI assistant integration (configure API keys via environment variables)

- English/Arabic localization via `l10n/`

## Project layout

- `lib/`

  - `core/` — shared utilities, theming, constants, and localization wiring
  - `features/` — feature modules (e.g., `auth`, `devices`, `patient_detail`, `medical_assistant`)
  - `navigation/` — routing configuration
  - `main.dart` — application entrypoint

- `assets/` — images and fonts (NeoSansArabic included)

- `android/`, `ios/` — platform-specific code and Firebase config files

- `test/` — unit and widget tests

## Major dependencies

Key packages (see `pubspec.yaml` for versions):

- `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `firebase_database`
- `flutter_bloc`, `equatable`
- `fl_chart`
- `flutter_localizations`, `intl`
- `shared_preferences`
- `flutter_dotenv`
- `http`
- `mobile_scanner`

## Local setup

Prerequisites:

- Flutter SDK (Dart >= 3.8). Verify with:

  ```bash
  flutter --version
  ```

- Android Studio or Xcode for emulators and platform tooling

Steps:

1. Clone the repository and open it:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd "MediGuard AI"
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. (Optional) Generate code (if your workflow uses code generation):

   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

Note: `flutter: generate: true` is enabled in `pubspec.yaml`, so some generated files may already exist.

## Firebase configuration

1. Create or use an existing Firebase project on the Firebase Console: [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

2. Add Android and/or iOS apps in the Firebase console and download the platform config files:

   - `google-services.json` → place into `android/app/`
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` → place into `ios/Runner/`

3. If `lib/firebase_options.dart` is used (generated by `flutterfire`), ensure it matches your Firebase project. You can generate it with `flutterfire configure`.

Security note: Do not commit production API keys or secrets. Use environment variables or CI secrets.

## Environment variables

If the app integrates external services (AI assistant, etc.), add a `.env` file in the repository root with required keys. Example:

```env
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AI_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com
```

Search the codebase for `flutter_dotenv` usage to find exact variable names required.

## Running the app

Run on the default connected device or emulator:

```bash
flutter run
```

List devices and run on a specific device:

```bash
flutter devices
flutter run -d <deviceId>
```

Build release artifacts:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
flutter build ios --release
```

## Testing

Run unit and widget tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

Add tests under the `test/` folder following existing patterns.

## Developer notes & edge cases

- Real-time streams: implement throttling/debouncing and reconnection strategies for Realtime Database listeners.

- Partial or malformed device payloads: parse defensively to avoid runtime crashes.

- Alerts: de-duplicate and rate-limit notifications to avoid alert storms.

- Platform permissions: handle runtime permissions for camera (scanner), Bluetooth, and background processing where applicable.

- Localization: ensure `l10n/` contains translations for user-facing strings and run `flutter gen-l10n` when needed.

Edge cases to manually test:

1. Device disconnects/reconnects with delayed timestamps
2. Offline behavior and synchronization when network recovers
3. Concurrent critical alerts from multiple patients

## Release checklist

- Rotate or remove development API keys and secrets
- Confirm Firebase platform files point to the correct project
- Test core flows on physical Android and iOS devices
- Verify localization for all target locales
- Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` in CI

## Further improvements (suggestions)

- Add a `docs/` folder with per-feature developer guides and API contracts
- Add integration tests that run against Firebase emulators
- Add CI workflows to run static analysis, tests, and build smoke artifacts

If you'd like, I can also generate an Arabic README (`README.ar.md`) or scaffold a `docs/` directory with quickstart guides for each feature.

## Where to find more context

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `UNIFIED_SYSTEM_README.md`, and `SUMMARY_COMPLETION.md` contain design notes and migration history.

## Suggestions / Next steps

- Generate a localized README in Arabic (`README.ar.md`).
- Scaffold a `docs/` directory with per-feature quickstarts and developer guides.

2. Intermittent network (offline-first UX) and data synchronization once back online.
3. Multiple simultaneous critical alerts from different patients.

## Where to find more context

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `UNIFIED_SYSTEM_README.md`, and `SUMMARY_COMPLETION.md` contain design notes and migration history.

## Suggestions / Next steps

- Generate a localized README in Arabic (`README.ar.md`).
- Scaffold a `docs/` directory with per-feature quickstarts and developer guides.

## Conformance note

This README intentionally references only the current product name and implementation. I scanned the repository and left other code and config unchanged; if you want a full rename or refactor (package names, imports, platform identifiers), I can prepare a safe migration plan and apply it once you approve.

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `UNIFIED_SYSTEM_README.md`, and `SUMMARY_COMPLETION.md` contain design notes and migration history.

## Next steps (optional help I can do)

- Create an English + Arabic README split (or `README.ar.md`).
- Add a `docs/` folder with per-feature developer guides.
- Create CI workflow that runs `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and builds a smoke APK.

If you'd like, I will now:

1. Open the updated `README.md` to verify the content and then mark the todo as completed.

   ## Suggestions / Next Steps

   - Add a `docs/` directory containing per-feature developer guides and API contracts.
   - Add integration tests that run against Firebase emulators to validate Realtime Database behavior without touching production.
   - Add CI checks to run `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and a smoke build on merge.

   ## Where to Look for More Context

   - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `UNIFIED_SYSTEM_README.md`, and `SUMMARY_COMPLETION.md` contain background decisions and migration notes.

   ***

   If you'd like, I can also:

   - Generate a separate localized README in Arabic.
   - Create a `docs/` scaffold with quickstart guides for new developers.
